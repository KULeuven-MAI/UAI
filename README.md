# UAI
Uncertainty In Artificial Intelligence.

# Cheat sheet

The [pdf of the cheat sheet can be found here](https://github.com/KULeuven-MAI/UAI/raw/master/cheatsheet.pdf) and obviously comes without any warranty of correctness (not for lack of trying to converge towards it though.) I was inspired by the cheat sheet by P. Carbonelle (see reference in pdf).
